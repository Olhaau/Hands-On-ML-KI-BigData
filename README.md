## Hands-On Big Data Processing
A overview of tasks to gain hands-on experience with Big Data infrastructures and possible experience gained by them.

### Optimize Data Processing On One Device
- [x] use the GPU-support of TensorFlow, see https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
- [x] optimize performance with TensorFlow's tf.data API, see https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance  
- [x] manage massive matrices with shared memory and memory-mapped files (e.g. bigmemory package for R), see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/bigmemory.pdf

### Configurate A Virtual Machine Cluster On A Single Host
- [ ] configurate e.g. Ubuntu over VirtualBox

<b> Remarks and Resources </b>
- remark: only for personal experience and just limited advantage in processing
- see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.mscs.doc/GUID-01B4B067-9AAC-41C0-BF9B-1D085F36DF51.html 

### Test The Application Of Cloud Computing Services 
- [ ] process data on e.g. MS Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, CloudLinux

<b> Remarks and Resources </b>
- a comparison of services can be found here: https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-computing-services

### Save And Process Data Remotely On A Server
- [ ] configurate e.g. a single Raspberry Pi server

<b> Remarks and Resources </b>
- see https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/raspberry-pi/2002251.htm

### Build A Big Data Laboratory Using Multiple Hosts 
- [ ] configurate a host cluster (e.g. a 3+ Raspberry Pi Cluster)
- [ ] manage cluster computing using a Hadoop and Spark framework

<b> Remarks and Resources </b>
